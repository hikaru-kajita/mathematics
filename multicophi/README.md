The first idea for this came up in 2023.10.04.

I only considered $\mathrm{co}\varphi^2$ at that time, and proved all theorems about it written in this paper.

I considered about the more general $\mathrm{co}\varphi^k$ in 2023.10.08, but I only focused on cases where solution to $\mathrm{co}\varphi^k (n)=C, C:\mathrm{const}$ could infinitely exist, and didn't paid attention to $n\leq C^2$.
This caused the paper written around that period to be complex, hard to understand and incomplete.

I realised this could be improved later by focusing on $n\leq C^2$, and the complete formulation and strict proof was done in 2025.08.05.

Update 2025.09.11: Added some fixes and made the condition for $\mathrm{co}\varphi^k (n)\leq 0$ stricter
